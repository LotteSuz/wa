# Project 0 :palm_tree:

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project contains 4 html files, together forming a website for PlantPower: a company which aims to protect the rainforest. To gain funds people can donate money or support the company through buying plants. If people want to simply learn more about the company, they can visit the 'about us' page.

The html files rely on bootstrap and a self-made stylesheet for their styling.
